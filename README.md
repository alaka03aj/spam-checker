# Spam Checker
The project was dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of smishing, a form of cybercrime that exploits many lives because of the difficulty in determining the authenticity of text messages. The primary focus was to design and implement an efficient machine learning model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.

The key idea involved the extraction of meaningful features from the processed text data from the dataset to represent each SMS message numerically. Through comprehensive performance evaluation, the model demonstrated promising results. It showcased the potential to effectively differentiate between legitimate and potentially malicious SMS messages, thus enhancing security for users.
